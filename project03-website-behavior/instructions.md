# Project 3: Website Behavior

*Due: Tuesday, November 23, 2021 (with extension into the holiday if necessary\*)*

For this project you will work with your team to **add a "behavior" layer** to your Project 2 website based on (at least) THREE JavaScript-powered plugins.  

The work will take all three team roles: IA, Designer, and Technician to do correctly, and it is critically important that you work together on this, i.e. communicate with each other! ...often and throughout the process.

A few notes, based on observations from the previous projects:

- **Avail yourself on the professor, early and often.**  Do not hack away endlessly.  When something is not working STOP and upload what you've got to the class web server (or your GitHub repo if you're using one).  Then go to Slack and post a question in the #help channel along with a link to your latest work.  The professor will make suggestions and in many cases, just tell you exactly what you need to do to fix the problem.  But you have to ask.  And don't wait until the last minute - don't wait until it's too close to the due date before reaching out for help.
- Remember: everyone on each team is graded equally at first, so **everyone has to ensure that <u>everything</u> is done** by the due date - even if it's not technically *your job*.  I.e. if you have to jump-in and cover for someone else on your team that's dropped the ball, then do so!  
- **Highlight team concerns early.** If you have any concerns about a team member(s) do not suffer in silence, and do not wait until the last minute when it's too late to recover.  Send a private DM to the professor in Slack and highlight your concerns.  The professor will not do anything nor repeat anything as to not embarrass anyone, but if you let him know, he can intervene and if nothing else, award extra points to you or anyone who does extra work.  
- Also regarding teams: keep in mind if you choose, **you can leave your current team** (no questions asked) and start a new one.  Your new team will still need a total of three team members so keep that in mind before committing to leave.  You'll need to line-up your new team beforehand.  If you're successful in creating a new team, let the professor know as soon as possible.

*\* If you really need more time you can continue to work on Project 3 over your Thanksgiving holiday.  The professor will hold-off and wait to grade yours after we get back.  But really, no one wants to do that!*

## Requirements

From a high-level the project requirement is to "add behaviors" to your team website using JavaScript libraries and plugins.  Specifically, you need to work as a team to ensure the following:

- There must be (at least) **THREE separate JavaScript-powered behaviors** added to the website
- Each of the behaviors **must ADD VALUE to the website**, i.e. the presence of the behaviors must objectively make the website better in terms of *readability* and/or *useability* (with the understanding that those terms are loosely defined in ISTE-140)
- One of the three behaviors must be: **fix the broken *current page highlighter***
- The other two behaviors must **do something to the *visual representation* of the content**.  (Note: there are a lot of libraries and plugins design for web applications and development support ...don't use any of those!)

## Step 1: Re-Form Teams

- If you havenâ€™t already, visit our [ISTE-140 City-Teams (Google Sheet)](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1c-SXrIti10_0lrW8V6KgVKQchu6ykPR3JEdp50Msh6Y/edit#gid=0) and place your name in the **Project 3** area, in a different role.
  - If you want to try working with a new team, now is the time to do that but keep in mind, the requirement to have *teams of three* is still a thing, so before committing to a new team make sure you have agreements with two other people
  - If you start a new team with new members, you can choose *any* existing Project 2 on which to base your Project 3


## Step 2: Decide What Behaviors, Where

*Typically, it would be the **Information Architect** who would take the lead with this, but keep in mind this needs to be <u>a team decision</u> because it's going to be the Technician who installs the behaviors and the Designer who customizes them.*

As a team, decide what to libraries/plugins implement and where in the website they'll go.  Suggestions...

- Look for "front-end" libraries or plugins; google something like "jquery front-end plugins" or more specifically, "jquery slideshow" ...or something like that
- It is okay to use any of the plugins referenced [here from: Day 23 in our Course Documentation website, archive](https://docs.iste140.org/schedule.html#thursday-november-11-2021), but it'd be cool to find something newer/better that the professor has never seen before
- Keep in mind, it'll be the Designer who will need to customize whatever is installed so it fits visually into the existing website; depending on what you decide, customization may or may not be very difficult

## Step 3: Prepare New Content as Needed

*Technically, anyone on the team can do anything, but it will be the person in the **Information Architect** role who will be solely responsible for the content used by the plugins to be complete and make-sense for how they're being presented in the website.*

- **Gather and prepare new content** required by the plugins and ensure they're appropriate for how the plugins will use them
- **Ensure the plugins are installed in areas of the website that make sense** for what they do, and they present the dynamic content in a way that *adds value* to the content, i.e. better than if the content were displayed in a static way (without JS).

## Step 4: Install the Behaviors

*This section will be the responsibility of the **Technician**.  Same as above, technically anyone can do anything, but if this part is done incorrectly, it will be the Tech who may lose points for this part.*

- Based on decisions of the team and new content from the IA, **install the JavaScript libraries and/or plugins** and required and ensure they work correctly
- As with the previous projects, the Technician is also responsible for ensuring HTML and CSS validation and that **all industry standards and best practices** (as defined in ISTE-140) are implemented; this includes fixing code written by the IA and Designer.  (If they make technical mistakes, it is the Technician - not them - who will lose points for that!)

## Step 5: Customize the Visual Appearance

*This section will be the responsibility of the **Designer**.  Same as above, technically anyone can do anything, but if this part is done incorrectly, it will be the Designer who may lose points for this part.*

- The **positioning and formatting of the libraries/plugins in the website *must* be customized** so it integrates into the overall look & feel of the existing website design
- Any changes to to the positioning/formatting or even the behavior itself **must *add value***, i.e. be better than if the new features were left to their own default appearance 
  - The position of the plugins within the existing layout must make sense from a visual standpoint.  For example, if an accordion plugin is installed in a narrow Aside, and when activated it creates a long, hard-to-read block of text ...that'd be a mistake
- At a bare minimum, the Designer must change *something/anything* - if for no other reason, just to demonstrate that they have the ability to do so; candidates for things to change include...
  - Fonts or any typographic qualities used within the plugins
  - Colors, borders, and/or any aspect of the box model

## Step 6: Report Your Work

IMPORTANT!  Even though everyone is being graded as a team (initially), everyone needs submit a link to your Project 3 website (the URL only) in MyCourses, in Assignments, into the Project 3 assignment.
