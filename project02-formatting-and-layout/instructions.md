# Project 2: Formatting and Layout

*Due: Thursday, November 11, 2021*

In this assignment, you will work with your team to build upon the HTML website you created in Project 1 and style it using CSS. The result will be a **formatted website** that has a **desktop and mobile-friendly layout**, plus other styles for **formatting and embellishment**.  There will also be other technical requirements based on new skills you've learned since Project 1.

## Step 1: Re-Form Teams

- If you havenâ€™t already, visit our [ISTE-140 City-Teams (Google Sheet)](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1c-SXrIti10_0lrW8V6KgVKQchu6ykPR3JEdp50Msh6Y/edit#gid=0) and place your name in the **Project 2** area - still in the same City-Team, but in a different role.

  - Note: for Project 2 we're going to temporarily redefine the roles; everyone will work on some aspect of the design (using CSS) because there's so much to do.  Specifics of who does what is listed below.


## Step 2: Apply a Layout

*Technically, anyone on the team can do anything, but it will be the person in the **Designer** role who will be solely responsible for the layout being done correctly.  I.e. if it is done incorrectly, it will be the Designer who may lose points for this part.*

### Requirements

- **Apply the layout suggested by the wireframe diagrams** from Project 1, on the Project 1 website.

...quite frankly, that's it^ but beware, that's a big task.  Also note, you will be graded against how well the actual layout implementation correlates to the wireframes.  It doesn't have to be perfect, but the more different it is, the lower the score.

- Also, **apply the "container trick"** to keep at least some of the content (if not all the content) centered in the middle of the viewport, so that no paragraphs of text ever extend wider than say, 700px or so, no matter how wide the viewport gets.  (Because that would be a readability issue.)
  - Note: there are other ways to ensure that text doesn't ever get too wide, but at least in one area of the website (anywhere) use the *container trick* just to demonstrate you're able to do it.

## Step 3: Apply Formatting and Embellishments  

*This section will be the responsibility of the **Information Architect**.  Same as above, technically anyone can  do anything, but if this part is done incorrectly, it will be the IA who may lose points for this part.*

- **Apply visual styles** to the Project 1 website that enhance its presentation; at a bare minimum, apply the styles listed below in the Requirements section, however you are encouraged to go above and beyond.
  - NOTE: "formatting and embellishments" generally refer to anything applied to the visual presentation that is *not* related to the layout (because that's the responsibility of the person in the Designer role).  However as you'll quickly find out, the styles you apply to enhance the appearance of the website are deeply connected to the layout.  That just means you need to work closely with the Designer to make sure you don't *step on each others' toes* so to speak.

### Requirements

*Note: as mentioned previously, these requirements below are the "bare minimum."  You should try to go above and beyond the minimums to get a better grade.  Also note, if you attempt something ambitious but make mistakes doing it, your attempt will offset the mistakes.  I.e. I'll forgive a few mistakes here and there if you really pull off something incredible!  On the other hand, if you only do the bare minimums you better make sure you did them perfectly because I'll grade them mercilessly.*  

#### Typography

Required: the fonts you chose to meet the requirements listed below should "pair well" with each other, and relate to the "mood" of the website as determined by the content.

- Change the base font of the entire website from the default (Times New Roman) to anything else that's appropriate for the content.  Note: you need to use an appropriate "font stack" anytime you change fonts.
- Change the fonts of at least three specific elements or sections from the new default you set (above^) to another, different font that pairs well.  

#### Embellishments

Required: changes to page colors/backgrounds, borders, and font colors must do so in ways that enhance the readability of the website.  

*Note: because we haven't studied the definition of "readability" in ISTE-140, the bar is very low, meaning you just have to try to make it look good!  If it really looks bad and hard to read, you'll lose points for that.*

- Apply various **background colors** and/or add **background images** of at least three elements
- Apply **the box model: borders, margins, padding** to at least three elements
- Apply various **text colors**, different from the default, to at least three elements
- Use at least three different applications of **pseudo classes** to apply styles anywhere in the website

## Step 4: Apply Mobile Styles and Technical Requirements

*Here too, the Technician is being coopted to do some design work, just because there's so much to do.  Same as with the other steps above, anyone can fulfill the following requirements but it is the **Technician** who may lose points if it isn't done correctly.*

- After the desktop version of the website is completed (layout and embellishments), fix the CSS so the website **displays correctly on mobile devices**, down to 414x736px (the size of an iPhone version 8) plus everything in-between.

...for the most part, that's it^ but beware, that's a big task.  

- Also, convert the website to PHP files and **implement PHP Includes** where appropriate
  - At a bare minimum, factor-out the navigation element plus at least one other area of redundant code.
- And also, ensure the entire website meets all **industry standards and best practices** that have been covered in ISTE-140; obvious areas of concern include but are not limited to:
  - HTML and CSS validation (eliminate errors, not warnings)
  - Use correct file and folder naming conventions
  - Use appropriate file sizes (especially the image files)
  - ...and a lot more

And finally, the technician is respoinsible for...

- Install the Project 2 website on the class webserver (under iste140.org) using any team member's account, in a folder named **project2**

## One more thing: Usability and Aesthetics

*Since everyone on your team is doing some level of design work, everyone should keep in mind the following...*

The web site's appearance must be usable and readable without strain.  Your design (formatting and layout) must have a subjectively pleasant aesthetic. Although artistic capabilities are not being graded, the webpage must not be sloppy.

- I will be very flexible when it comes to judging aesthetics. Only really, *really* ugly or sloppy designs will be penalized (unless you're being ironic, in which case you need to make it clear that you're being so.)
- Proper contrast between foreground and background must be maintained to make the webpage easy to read
- Fonts (type, size, style and color) must be appropriate for viewing the website on desktops, tables, and mobile phones.
- Ample use of the box model (margin, padding,borders) to create white space must be used to separate areas of content into clearly delineated sections.

To be able to pull this off^ you really need to approach the design *as a team*.  Do not make arbitrary design choices individually.  That would result in something that looks bad and potentially hard to read and/or look at ...and that would lose points!

## Report Your Work

IMPORTANT!  Even though everyone is being graded as a team (initially), everyone needs submit a link to your Project 2 website (the URL only) in MyCourses, in Assignments, into the Project 2 assignment.
