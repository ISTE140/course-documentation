*Day 13: Introduction to Project 1*

Note: the projector in the classroom was broken so we were limited as to what we could do

- Form Teams: [ISTE-140 City-Teams (Google Sheet)](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1c-SXrIti10_0lrW8V6KgVKQchu6ykPR3JEdp50Msh6Y/edit#gid=0)

  1. If you haven't already, use the Google Sheet^ to list your "Preferred role" (next to your name); and add some notes about yourself (optionally)
     - **Information Architect (IA)** - the person who will wrangle the content (mostly focused on HTML and document structure)
     - **Designer** - the person who will create the wireframes and chose the look & feel for the website (mostly focused on CSS)
     - **Technician** - the person will will host the website, install the JavaScript plugins (when we learn about that) and ensure it meets all technical standards and industry best practices

  2. Then reach out to two other students in the "Pick list" to form a team
     - Advice: choose a students who have skills you *don't* have. The best teams are technically diverse - not just a team of friends.
     - You DM each other here in Slack to contact each other

  3. Once you have an agreement to form a team, move (drag and drop) your names from the pick list to an unoccupied team column
     - Everyone has to pick an initial role for themselves: IA; Designer; or Technician. (You can change later if you want.)

  4. Create a private channel for your team here in Slack: one team member creates the channel and then invites the other members
  5. As a team, decide in which city your team will be based. (This is just a team-building activity. It doesn't really affect anything.)
  6. As a team, propose a topic for your website (discussion and decision needs to be lead by the IA, but there needs to be a consensus among the team); then write the topic in the Google Sheet (row 5)
     - Note: you can change the topic later if need be; it's just a proposal at this time

  7. As a team, gather resources from which the IA will build the website
     - Required: there needs to be *at least* two sources for content (more would be better); one of them can be Wikipedia, but there has to be more
     - Suggestion: start finding websites with good/usable content and paste URLs in your private Slack channel; good resources will have plenty of text, images, and if applicable other media (videos, embedded games, whatever)

  More, coming soon...
