# Lab 8: Wireframe
*Due: Tuesday, September 28, 2021*

The purpose of this lab is to practice using wireframing software of your choice, to prepare for Project 1.  

## Step 1: Tool Choice

- Pick a design tool to help with wireframing, and learn how to use it (note: you don't need to become an expert; just learn the basics)
  - Note: it is okay to use pencil & paper, but as an exercise for this class you still need to translate your paper sketches to an electronic format using some off-the-shelf software
  - Examples of software that you can use to develop a wireframe diagram
    - [Adobe XD ($)](https://www.adobe.com/products/xd.html) or Google "adobe xd alternative"
    - [Figma](https://www.figma.com/)
    - [Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/)
    - Others (if you find a good one, share it in our #chatter channel in Slack)

## Step 2: Inspiration

- Find a fairly simply designed webpage – anywhere on the web – that looks like it has an interesting layout you'd like to replicate with your own styles and content
  - NOTE: a good-looking website doesn’t necessarily have a good or interesting layout! Beware of websites where the look and feel comes from large images and/or video elements. (That’s not layout – that’s just good photography.) Look for something that has elements positioned side-by-side
  - Also note, don't be overly (or *underly* ...?) ambitious.  Whatever you find needs to be challenging but not outrageously complex.  If you are not sure don't hesitate to grab a link and post it in our #chatter channel.
- Keep in mind, the webpage you choose as inspiration is only that - inspiration.  You do not have to faithfully represent it when you create your wireframe diagram.  In fact you may chose multiple webpages as inspiration and combine elements from each in your own wireframe.
- When you make a decision about the webpage you plan to use as inspiration for your wireframe, take note of the URL(s).  You'll need to turn-in the address of the webpage(s) with this lab assignment.

## Step 3: Create

- Create a wireframe diagram of the webpage you chose (just one diagram of one webpage)
  - If the webpage you chose features navigation, you can leave that out; for now we're just working with singular webpages, however...
  - If the webpage you chose uses "in-page" navigation to scroll the user to another area of the same webpage, then you *may* include it in your wireframe diagram
  - The wireframe must be “low fidelity” – don’t add detail or specific content - NO real words, colors, or images. Just boxes and boxes within boxes. 
  - Regarding the level of detail in your wireframe: the trick is to know when to stop! There are lots of examples of wireframe diagrams - just Google it.  Your wireframe diagram should look like those.  (BTW - remember the difference between "wireframe" and "mockup")
  - Add labels to your diagram to indicate elements that have specific purposes, e.g. "main content area" or “banner” etc.; make sure the labels don’t look like they’re part of the design

## Step 4: Report your work

- You need to turn-in your wireframe diagram in MyCourses, however if the software you chose to develop your wireframe diagram saves files in a proprietary format (likely) you need to export your diagram into a more universally accessible format like a JPG, PNG, PDF, etc.
- To receive credit for this Lab, in our MyCourses section, in Assignments: Lab 8, 
  - Upload your wireframe diagram (JPG, PDF, or some other common format)
  - Also, indicate what software you used to generate your wireframe diagram (just write-in the name of the software)
  - And include a link(s) to the webpage(s) you used for inspiration for the wireframe diagram
